Image Classification with Multi-threading
=========================================

This code provides a simple example of how to classify images using a TensorFlow model and multi-threading in Python.

Requirements
------------

To use this code, you will need to have the following libraries installed:

*   `concurrent.futures`: Provides support for multi-threading in Python.
*   `numpy`: A library for working with numerical data.
*   `PIL.Image`: A library for working with images in Python.
*   `tensorflow`: A library for machine learning tasks, including training and evaluating models.

You will also need a trained TensorFlow model saved to a file named `model.h5`.

How to Use
----------

To use this code, you will need to provide a list of image data to classify. The image data can be in any format that is supported by the `PIL.Image.open()` function, such as JPEG or PNG.

The code will create a thread pool with 4 worker threads, and will submit a classification task for each image in the `image_list` to the pool. The `classify_image()` function will be run in a separate thread for each task, and will use the trained TensorFlow model to classify the image.

The classification results will be returned
